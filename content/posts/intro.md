# Who am I?

My name is Austin, I'm 29, I live in Cincinnati OH, come fight me. 

I work as a DevOps engineer for GE, for our internal Web Services/Web Hosting group.

I enjoy:

- Vidya
- Cooking
- Homelabbery 
- Programming
- Music (Guitar, Drums, Vocals)
- Sharing things I've learned

# What is this place?

I've wanted a blog for as long as I can remember. As I've gotten older, (into my late 20s at the time of writing this), I've struggled with depression, anxiety and a host of other health issues; tldr, now, more than ever, **I need a place for my thoughts.**

I've also picked up a number of hobbies along the way, and I'd like to share some of those experiences with the world. 

# What are you going to write about?

Anything and everything I feel like writing about but mainly tech stuff and cooking. 

# Are you any good at writing? 

Nope. 

Hope someone finds this content useful.

\- Austin
